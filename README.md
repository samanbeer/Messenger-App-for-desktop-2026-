Messenger App for any Desktop device supporting Python 3.13 or any Windows 10 or above. (Compiled version avaiable from releases page. No python needed)

Facebook cut off support for messenger app for desktop app so this is my alternative.
It is just a webView and some functions so Audio/Video calls will work.
